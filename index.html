        <p>I am a Professional Services Engineer at DialogTech!</p>

        <p>I am very self-driven, motivated and eager to learn new things; experienced in working in fast-paced, client-driven environments demanding strong organizational, creative and management skills. I enjoy working in environments where employees are expected to contribute to an atmosphere in which everyone is pulling in the same direction towards the same desired result. I have a tremendous ability to gather, interpret and critically evaluate any information I am given.</p>

        <p>The purpose of my current role is to provide support on any issues our clients bring to our attention and make sure they are fully informed, satisfied, educated on the matter at hand, and hope a solution is provided/implemented by myself based on the situation at hand. My role ensures our company succeeds because I provide a lifeline to our frustrated customers who encounter problems during the use of our product.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day I am someone who is able to take take a poorly designed and described problems and come up with a well thought out solution.</p>
